As Paul wrapped up his letter to the church at Philippi, he shared his heart with these believers who had meant so much to him in his ministry. The themes of gratitude, the true meaning of their gifts to him, and the grace of God are equally desirable for us, as we strive to be a church as uncommon as the one in Philippi.
