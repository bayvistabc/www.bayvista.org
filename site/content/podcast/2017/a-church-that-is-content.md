The church at Philippi had wanted to help Paul with his ministry for a long time, and as Paul was writing this letter, he had received help from them again after some time had passed. In thanking them, he explains how he has learned that his contentment does not come from his circumstances. True contentment is only found as we depend on God, trusting that He knows what we need.
