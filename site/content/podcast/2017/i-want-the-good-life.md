Mankind, throughout time, has sought to live the "good life," a meaningful life free from cares and struggles. Today, as we begin the series "Pearls of Wisdom," we look at Solomon's opening words in the book of Proverbs. These words remind us of our need for wisdom, our need for learning, and our need to revere the God Who is the source of all wisdom and knowledge.
