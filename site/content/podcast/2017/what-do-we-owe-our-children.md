If you give children what they want, they will be happy and they will like you. While this sounds like a nice sentiment, life does not work quite that way. We do not owe our children the latest devices, the largest house, or the biggest birthday parties; according to Scripture, we owe them spiritual training, discipline, and a living heritage of love.
