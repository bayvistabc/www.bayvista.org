Fourteen years ago, Paul Barnard planted a church in Magee, Mississippi, with the goal of reaching the lost. By taking opportunities most "church people" would not take, Overflow Church has grown to 800 people, using no marketing, advertising, or gimmicks. He is now the director of the [242 Network](http://www.242network.com), which screens, trains, and walks beside church planters to help them reach the lost, rather than simply attracting dissatisfied churchgoers from existing churches. He challenged us to do the same in our community, winning souls not by inviting them to church, but by forming relationships that allow us to share our faith.
