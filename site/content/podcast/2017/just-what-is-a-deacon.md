This Sunday was Deacon Nomination Sunday, so we took a break from our "Pearls of Wisdom" study to look at the office of deacon. The office originated as a way for the early church to heal a growing division; today, deacons can help heal local bodies by being willing to serve, exercising their gifts, and being men of godly character. But, when we look at it further, we see that these requirements are no different than the expectations God has placed on every believer.
