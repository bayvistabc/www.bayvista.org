Paul switches from running images to military ones, as he encourages the church at Philippi to stand firm, just as a Roman guard would when he was acting under orders. Realizing that this world will be hostile to our efforts, we must be sure that we are committed to living for Christ in this world, while looking forward with an expectant hope that something greater is coming.
