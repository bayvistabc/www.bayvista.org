Mary Callahan, together with her husband Roy, are the directors of Hands UP Outreach in Rankin County, Mississippi. Their ministry is primarily focused on the prisons in that area, and they provide many resources, including Bible studies, GED tutoring, literacy, and ESL programs. Mary encouraged us to open our eyes to the opportunities around us.
