James cautions his readers to not presume positions of leadership in the church; rather, if they are called by God, they should faithfully execute their calling, realizing that they will be judged more strictly. He also reminds them that we all stumble; no one is perfect. This is good advice, both for the newly ordained and installed deacons, and the rest of us as well.
