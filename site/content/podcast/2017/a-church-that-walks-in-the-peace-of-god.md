Paul encouraged the church at Philippi to rejoice in the Lord at all times, to reflect Him in their lives, and to trust Him for their needs. Paul describes the peace that they will experience as a peace that defies understanding. Today, we too can walk in this peace, as we joyfully yield to and trust Jesus.
