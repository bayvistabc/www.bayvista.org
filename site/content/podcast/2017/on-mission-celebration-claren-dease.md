Claren Dease, along with her husband Lyle, served in Uruguay for over twenty years. Over that time, God used them to plant churches, sharing His love with the people there, and many of their church plants are now continuing the work themselves. They recently came back to the United States, but are excited about the new ways that the "next generation" is continuing to spread the gospel around the world.
