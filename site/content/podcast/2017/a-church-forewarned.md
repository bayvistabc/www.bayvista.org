As Paul shifts from his focus on unity, he warns the church at Philippi to be wary of people who would add anything as a condition of salvation. If Jesus' work is sufficient, it needs nothing added; and, if it needs something added, it is not sufficient. Legalism is a trap that can rob us of our joy, and even our ability to worship in spirit and truth.
