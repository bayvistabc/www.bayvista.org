As we take an in-depth look at the Lord's Supper, we find that it requires several different looks from us, both in preparation and response. Not only do we remember Christ's sacrifice for our sins, we must ensure we are right with Him, we can look forward to His return, and we are inspired to share the good news of His sacrificial love with the world around us.
