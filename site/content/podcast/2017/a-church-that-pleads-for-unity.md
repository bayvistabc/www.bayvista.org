Two ladies in the church at Philippi had a falling out; Paul encouraged the church to take an active role in restoring their relationship, so that they could once again work together for the gospel.  We, too, should not let disagreements get in the way of our service, and we should be willing to help others restore their relationships when they need assistance.
