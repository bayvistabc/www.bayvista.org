Today, we were honored to have Michelle Beadle, a Messianic Jew based in New Orleans, walk us through the Passover meal (seder). Most of us know about communion, the first Lord's Supper, and that Jesus was crucified and rose again during the Passover festival; however, the number of ways that this meal points to Him is much larger than many people realize.
