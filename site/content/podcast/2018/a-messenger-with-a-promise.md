The prophecy we read today was not quite the response that the original recipients thought they would receive; they questioned God's justice (and, thus, His character). God's response was that messengers were coming - yet, the messengers were not bringing a message that God's people could do no wrong. Rather, the message is that God's people will be refined and purified. While the world stands at the brink of judgment, God's people will not be ultimately destroyed; the often-painful refining will lead to true peace.
