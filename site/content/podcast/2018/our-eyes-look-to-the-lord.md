This psalm of ascent is also a psalm of lament; it expresses the heart of a servant of God who has taken more than they thought they could take. Their only hope is to look to the Lord for His salvation. Like them, we need to set our eyes on the Lord, and trust Him to bring deliverance and mercy to us.
