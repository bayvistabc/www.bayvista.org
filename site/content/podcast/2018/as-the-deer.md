The verbiage of Psalm 42 is nowhere near as beautiful as the melody of the song "As the Deer." The image in this psalm is one of an individual going through spiritual drought and a deluge of hopelessness, longing desperately to know that God has not forsaken them. Multiple times, though, we see this cry of despair followed by a statement of hope, thanks to the strength provided from God.
