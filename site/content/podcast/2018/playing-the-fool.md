The word "fool", even in our day, is a rather harsh word; we will all end up playing the fool, though. Psalm 14 describes the ungodly fool, and the doom that awaits him. However, if we live godly lives, Paul lets us know that the world will consider us fools; our salvation is diametrically opposed to what the world values.
