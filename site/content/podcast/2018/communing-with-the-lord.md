While Southern Baptists typically call the second ordinance of the church "The Lord's Supper," it is also known as "Communion." Partaking in this ordinance is a call to fellowship with our Lord and with His Church; it calls us away from idolatry, reminds us of Christ's sacrifice, and calls us to embrace our fellow believers.
