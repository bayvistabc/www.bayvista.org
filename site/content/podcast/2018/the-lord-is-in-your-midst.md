The kingdom of Judah had earned God's judgment, and Zephaniah had prophesied its coming. His last prophecy, though, was one of great joy, promising that there was a Coming One Who would forgive them, restore them, bring them victory, and bring them home. The prophecy wasn't just for Judah; it will be fulfilled when Christ returns to reign over His creation.
