John follows up his introduction in his letter to his "little children" _(which, sadly, did not get recorded last week, due to a lightning strike hitting our sound board)_ by giving them clear instruction to "walk in the light." Walking in the light involves acknowledging the character of God, living as those whom He has changed, and opening facing our sin.
