Jeremiah, known as the "Weeping Prophet," did not enjoy bringing prophecies of judgment, but the majority of the messages God gave him to proclaim were judgment on Israel for their sin. However, he did bring an encouraging Messianic prophecy, telling God's people that their trouble and judgment would not go on forever. This prophecy brought a promise of hope in a time of despair, a promise of righteousness in a world of injustice, and a promise of salvation to a people in bondage.
