David sinned, and thought he'd gotten away with it for nearly a year; then, Nathan appeared and, through God, convicted him of that sin. This psalm is David's prayer for forgiveness, and demonstrates the heart of repentance we need to have. If we truly repent, we can trust that God's forgiveness is real, and help us turn ourselves to Him.
