Life can be painful, and simply being a follower of Christ does not exempt us from that reality. What Scripture does teach us, though, is that there is purpose in our pain. It reminds us that all of us need comfort; that God is the One Who can provide it; that this comfort goes well beyond alleviating our personal pain; and that our pain more fully prepares us to minister to others experiencing that same pain.
