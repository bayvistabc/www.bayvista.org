The people of Israel were under the judgment of God; in this psalm, they call out to Him to revive them. Toward the middle of the song, though, one voice rises above the rest to declare that he is ready to hear the Lord, and will hear Him when He speaks. The parallel to today's church is easy to see; we, too, need revival, and we will only experience it if the people of God listen to what He is telling us to do.
