Psalm 46 celebrates God's power through the image of a strong fortress. A fortress isn't immune to the chaos around it, but its strength protects those within as chaos ensues. Our fortress also provides protection when enemies attack, and will one day put an end to the chaos and attacks with the word "ENOUGH!"
