God's sovereignty is not a topic that gets a lot of attention; it's not one of the more popular doctrines, because its implications are not always pleasant. However, a proper view of the sovereignty of God shows us that the King of the world is not a distant power; this God moves on and within this world, and wants a personal, intimate relationship with us, His creation.
