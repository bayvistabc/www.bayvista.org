When Jesus cried out "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?", he was quoting Psalm 22:1. This psalm both described a person in a desparate situation, and was a prophecy that pointed forward to Christ. Through this suffering, though, the psalmist praises the Lord for not hiding His face, and hearing his cry for help.
