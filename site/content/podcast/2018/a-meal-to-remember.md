When Jesus ate the Passover meal with His disciples, just before He was betrayed, He changed that meal from one that remembered God's provision in Egypt to one that would remember Him. Whenever we participate, we share with our family, we look forward in hope, and we let the remembrance inspire us to gratitude for His sacrifice.
