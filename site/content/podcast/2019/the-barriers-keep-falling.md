As believers were scattered, after the persecution that started after Stephen's martyrdom, a group of believers made it to the city of Antioch. While others had sought out Jews to convert, this group went to Greeks - and had great success! The church in Jerusalem learned of it, and sent Barnabas to them. Through this, we seen how God wants us to broaden our vision, how He will encourage us wheverever we go, and how He rewards our hearts when we reach out with compassion for others.
