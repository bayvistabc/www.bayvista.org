Many people today are fixated on various things - cell phones, social media, politics, and the like. As Christians, though, our efforts should be fixed on God's purpose for our lives; as we do this, we must be sure we are not focusing on the wrong thing (even though it may be a good thing), or focusing on simply keeping things the same. God has called us to be His witnesses here, today.
