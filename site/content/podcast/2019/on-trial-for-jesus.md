Stephen was one of the first-ever deacons. He was not just someone who helped behind the scenes, though; he had a testimony of being a powerful witness for Christ, preaching and teaching with authority. Through looking at his trial, complete with hired false witnesses, we see the problems they had with him; these are the same problems the world has with us today.
