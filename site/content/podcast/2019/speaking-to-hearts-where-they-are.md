When Paul encountered philosophers while traveling alone through Athens, he siezed the opportunity to address the people where they were, using that as an inroad to preach the gospel. We, too, have a great opportunity in our world, where 90% of Americans still believe in a "higher power" of some sort, to speak about the gospel. It still runs contrary to human understanding, but God can still change hearts when His truth is declared.
