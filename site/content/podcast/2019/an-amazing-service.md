Every time we participate in the Lord's Supper, we should remember that this special time of remembrance is a symbol of the love of Jesus.  We should also celebrate the truth of His return.  Finally, we should treat this as something special because we come together with the church, not just of today, but with the church throughout time, when we observe this ordinance.
