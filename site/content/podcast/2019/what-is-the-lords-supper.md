While generations of faithful believers have debated over what the Lord's Supper is, how frequently it should occur, etc., they have all realized that it is a crucial part of our worship. It was one of our Lord's final requests, it shows our commitment (to the Lord and to one another), and it reminds us to celebrate and proclaim what the Lord did for us on the cross.
