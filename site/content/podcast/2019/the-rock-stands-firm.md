Peter came a long way from the disciple who denied Jesus 3 times before He was crucified. On Pentecost, Peter stood up firm in his belief in the One Who had restored him. God's work through Peter serve as an example to us on how God empowers His people as they stand boldly and proclaim His Word; He gives us the courage to stand, an understanding of His purposes, words that can penetrate hearts, and the only source of spiritual regeneration and growth.
