The church at Antioch did something that no other church had done up to this point in history - they commissioned a team of men to go evangelize other areas. Through this, we see how God uses specific people for specific tasks, encourages His people with spiritual confirmation, and uses the same principles even while working in varied ways with varied individuals. We must not "audit" the Christian life!
