The Gospel message cannot be hindered by those who stand against it.  It is a triumphant Gospel that is welcomed by those who are drawn to it; it is a message that goes into the world with boldness, when God's people are obedient to his call.  Paul demonstrated this throughout his ministry, even when he was on house arrest in Rome, awaiting his trial before Caesar.
