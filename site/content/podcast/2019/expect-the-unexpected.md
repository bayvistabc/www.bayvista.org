Following the mission team split, Barnabas and John Mark continued on to visit the churches that were started on the first missionary journey.  Paul and Silas traveled throughout Asia-minor with the plan to spread the gospel as they went.  Instead, the Spirit of God prevented them from the work in Asia-minor, and instead directed them to Macedonia, where some of the strongest New Testament churches began, including the church at Philippi.
