After Peter and John got in trouble with the authorities, they were charged to stop preaching about Jesus. When they met back up with the other believers, though, they did not gather everyone up to tell them about their new clandestine gospel program; rather, they prayed that they would be even more bold in sharing the good news of Jesus Christ! They remembered what God had already done, and relied on His power to continue their ministry; 2,000 years later, we should do nothing less ourselves.
