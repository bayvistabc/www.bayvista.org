When Saul was converted, the members of the church did not trust that his conversion was real. Barnabas stepped up, though, and vouched for him and his teaching. Through their story, we can see how friends can help us maintain hope, keep strength in the face of opposition, and accomplish more together for the Kingdom of God than we could have accomplished alone.
