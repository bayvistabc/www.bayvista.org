Just before Jesus ascended, He told His disciples to go to Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and the uttermost parts of the earth. However, years after His ascension, the church was still centered in Jerusalem. When Saul began persecuting the church, many of its members fled - but, as they went, they continued sharing the good news, and people were saved. It was only through the power of God, though, that they were able to do this.
