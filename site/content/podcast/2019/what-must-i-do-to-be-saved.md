Paul and Silas find themselves thrown in prison after casing a spirit of divination out of a slave girl who had been following them.  As they were locked in a cell, their feet in the stocks, singing and praising God, an earthquake of supernatural origin caused all of the doors and locks to be opened.  When the jailer saw that the prison was open and all of his prisoners must have escaped, he despaired and planned to take his own life.  When Paul called out to stop him, and assured him that all of the prisoners were still in their cells, the jailer asked the most important question of his life.  What must I do to be saved.
