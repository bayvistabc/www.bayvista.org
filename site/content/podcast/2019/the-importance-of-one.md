We tend to think of "mighty moves of God" as times when large numbers of people came to a saving knowledge of Christ. Today, though, we look at an occasion where God called Philip away from a flourishing work, to a one-on-one opportunity with an Ethiopian eunuch who was trying to understand Isaiah. Through this, we see how God calls each of us to be witnesses for Him wherever we go.
