On the day we light the Christ Candle, Brother Danny reminds us of four essential truths about what we should be celebrating at Christmastime.  First, that this is a celebration of the eternal Word of God.  Second, we are celebrating the Light that conquers darkness.  Third, we celebrate the gift that brings us into the family of God.  And, finally, we celebrate the fullness of God made flesh.
