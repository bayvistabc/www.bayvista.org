As Paul was making his way to Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit was telling him, and others, that he was headed for much trouble there. Many of these other people discouraged Paul from continuing; though their intentions were good, they were completely misunderstanding the message they were being given. We, too, must be sure that we do not misinterpret what God is telling us, and be careful to not end up playing the role of the tempter in their lives.
