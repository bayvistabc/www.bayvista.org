As Paul and Barnabas come to the end of their missionary journey, they revisited some of the churches they planted as they went, stopping by each one to encourage and teach these young believers. Their efforts strengthened these local bodies, and can teach us much about how we should work together with other believers to become the strong body of Christ we are called to be.
