The early church is, once again, facing persecution. James, the brother of John, has been captured and killed, and Peter is in prison, awaiting trial after the holy days surrounding Passover. The church is praying for him, while at the same time, he is being freed from prison; when he appears, they do not want to believe it! This story shows us how God can move beyond our expectations when we pray, often not directly answering our specific prayer, but answering the underlying need. He knows the dangers that exist in life, He listens to the cries of our heart, and He works through our less-than-perfect faith to accomplish His will through us.
