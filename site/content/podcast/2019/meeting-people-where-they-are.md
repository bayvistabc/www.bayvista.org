As Paul continued through his travels in Macedonia, he finds himself in the city of Athens.  Struck by their idolatry, Paul seeks to meet the residents of Athens where they are, in their context to share the truth of the gospel.  This passage is a great example of how we, in 21st century America, should seek to share the gospel message with the people around us, wherever they happen to be.
