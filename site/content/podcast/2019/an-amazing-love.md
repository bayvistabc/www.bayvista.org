On the fourth Sunday of Advent, Brother Danny shares with us the amazing nature of God's love toward His people.  In the first chapter of Matthew, we see the story of Jesus' birth, from the prespective of Joseph.  Matthew shows us the love that Joseph and Mary had for God, the love that Joseph had for Mary, and the love that caused God to send his son for his people.
