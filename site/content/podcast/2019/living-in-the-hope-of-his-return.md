As we celebrate the first week of the Advent Season, Brother Danny reminds us to look forward in the hope of Jesus' return.  Using the text from Romans 13, Danny reminds the church that time is running out for us to wake from our restful slumber of complacency and our predilection towards the ways of darkness.  To try to walk the line between the world of darkness and the kingdom of God is not right, nor is it safe.  Rather, it is time to be fully clothed in the righteousness of Jesus as we await his return in a spirit of Hope.
