Stephen provided a powerful witness to the truth of Christ, and how everything from Moses and the prophets pointed to Him. However, his words angered the religious leaders, who literally covered their ears and yelled while taking him out to be stoned. They did not want to obey the truth of Stephen's testimony, they did not want to yield to God, and they worked to silence those from whom God brings conviction; sounds familiar, doesn't it?
