Paul instructed at least two of his churches about how the body of Christ was supposed to function. In our focus passage, he dealt with a church where the members were not seeing the value of other members, not understanding that each part has a vital role to play. However, for the body to be what it is called to be, each member needs to actually be performing its part to the best of its ability.
