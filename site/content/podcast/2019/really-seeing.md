Some time after Pentecost, Peter and John were going into the temple for mid-afternoon prayer. They had probably walked past the same beggar many times, but on this day, they _truly_ saw him. They had no money, but they knew that what he really needed was to be introduced to Jesus. In the same way, we should strive to truly see those around us, and share Jesus with them.
