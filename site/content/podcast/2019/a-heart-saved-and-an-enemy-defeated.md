Saul, Barnabas, and John Mark, having been commissioned by the church in Antioch, set out for the island of Cyprus. They make their way from their original port to the captial, where the governor wants to hear what they have to say; however, a sorcerer understands who they are and resists. Through their efforts, we see three ways God leads His people to victory and draws others to Himself.
