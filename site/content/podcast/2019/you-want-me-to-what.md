God had a plan to turn Saul into Paul, and that plan involved training from a devoted follower of Jesus named Ananias. Ananias knew Saul's reputation, though, and was quite surprised when God's call came. Through his story, though, we see that even though God may call us to difficult circumstances, but result in more good than we expect, and even healings we wouldn't have imagined.
