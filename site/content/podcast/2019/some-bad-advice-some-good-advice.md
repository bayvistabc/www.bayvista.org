When Peter and the apostles appeared before the Sanhedrin (the council of Jewish leaders), they professed that they would continue to preach Jesus. While there was some seemingly wise counsel from one of their more learned members, a closer analysis shows that it was bad advice. The world's wisdom often looks at God's wisdom as foolishness, but Peter and the apostles stayed true to God's wisdom; we should as well.
