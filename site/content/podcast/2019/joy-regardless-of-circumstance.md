Using the text of Mary's song of praise and worship, The Magnificat, Bill helps us to understand that the joy that we celebrate at Advent is not something that can be stolen from us.  Rather, we fail to live in that joy when we surrender to the troubles, trials, and tribulations of this world.  Let us remember that the joy in our lives is one of the ways we are to shine the light of Jesus Christ to a world that is dark and hopeless.
