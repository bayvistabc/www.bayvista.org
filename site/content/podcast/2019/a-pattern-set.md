As Luke continues to chronicle Barnabas and Paul's journey and missing stops, a pattern emerges that will repeat itself in several different places. These two men seek out the synagogue as they traveled, and went there first to bring the good news to the Jews, then speaking to the Gentiles as well. We can learn several principles from their pattern, including our need to be grounded in the Word, being ready to share whenever we have opportunity, being willing to move on when we are rejected, and continuing to sow seed until we find a harvest.
