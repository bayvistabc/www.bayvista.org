Today's passage is one of the more difficult passages in the book of Acts. However, it is not a story of a God overreacting to a little sin; rather, it expresses the seriousness with which God views hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is the tool of the enemy, challenges our integrity, and can attack our very commitment to God.
