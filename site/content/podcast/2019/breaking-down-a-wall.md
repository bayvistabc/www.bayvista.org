In today's passage, Luke pivots from Saul/Paul to Peter and Cornelius; the former is "the rock" who followed Christ while He was on the earth, and the latter is a Roman centurion. These two me would seem to have little to nothing in common with one another; however, through the power of God, the wall separating these two men is torn down, and they are both better off because of it.
