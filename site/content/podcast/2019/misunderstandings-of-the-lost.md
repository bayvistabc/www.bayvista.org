Paul and Barnabas heal a man in Lystra, and instead of praising God, the people begin to worship Paul and Barnabas as human incarnations of Zeus and Hermes. Meanwhile, some of the same people who had been so violently against them in Antioch came into town, and ended up getting the people of Lystra to stone Paul, leaving him for dead; however, he recovered and continued preaching. This shows us that, in the course of sharing the gospel, a lost world can perceive what we are doing in ways we do not intend; these can lead us to think more highly of ourselves than we should, and can also lead others to attack us, in an attempt to destroy our faith.
