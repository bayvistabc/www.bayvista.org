The Lord's Supper is a memorial to Christ's sacrifice. It not only reminds us of what He has done, it also shows us how far we have drifted, and helps us understand that He can change us into what we were created to be.

_(There were two periods of silence during the service that have been removed from this recording, one for technical issues and one for a time of reflection.)_
