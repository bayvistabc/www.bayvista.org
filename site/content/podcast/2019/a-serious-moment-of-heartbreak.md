As Paul and Barnabas continue on their mission work, a point of conflict arises concerning the inclusion of John Mark in the mission work.  This passage teaches us that even though we may share a vision with other believers about the work of the kingdom, conflict will arise within the body.  When it does, we need to seek forgiveness and reconcilliation, and we need to stand amazed that God will use our folly to further the growth of his kingdom.
