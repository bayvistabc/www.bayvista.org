Every so often, someone preaches a sermon that changes the course of history; Jonathan Edwards' "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" kicked off the first Great Awakening in the United States, and Dr. R. G. Lee's "Payday Someday" saw massive results wherever he preached it. In today's passage, we read about the first sermon preached directly to the Gentiles, and it had massive results as well.

_(At the end of the message, there was a [snippet from Dr. S. M. Lockridge's "He's My King" message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKsN-AeqJP0) that is not in this recording.)_
