As we look at Isaiah chapter 11, Brother Bill talks to us about the importance of living out our lives in realization of the peace that we have through Jesus Christ.  When Jesus returns, there will be peace in creation that we cannot comprehend.  The shoot that arises from the stump of Jesse will bring peace through knowlede of Him.
