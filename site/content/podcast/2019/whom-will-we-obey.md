The apostles were arrested; but, before the Sanhedrin could covene a trial, God released them from prison and told them to go back where they had been and resume preaching. When the church authorities found them, they threatened them, and told them to stop preaching. Peter, speaking for the group, powerfully expressed that they were living in ultimate allegiance to God, not man.
