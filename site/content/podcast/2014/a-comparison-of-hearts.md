In the parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector, we find a parable that was not explained itself, but the reason that it was told was written. Jesus once again emphasized the importance of the heart in becoming a citizen of the kingdom of God.

_The song "Better Than the Pharisees" was performed by Jay Rustin._
