If something catches Jesus' eye and makes Him pay attention, we should probably pay attention with Him. We take a break from parables to look at the story commonly known as "The Widow's Mite."

In the sermon, you will hear references to a video, as well as to songs. We were honored to have [The Men of Music][mom], a Southern Gospel trio, worship with us this morning. The video is on the front page of their website.
