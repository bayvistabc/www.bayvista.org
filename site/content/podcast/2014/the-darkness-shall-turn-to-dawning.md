When Mary came to the tomb that Sunday morning, she wasn't singing "Low in the grave He lay." All she knew was that He was gone. But, with one word, Jesus broke through her darkness and transformed her sorrow into joy. Bro. Danny takes us through this early Sunday morning garden encounter, and reminds us that He still does this today.
