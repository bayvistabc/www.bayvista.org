David came to be known by killing Goliath during a war between Israel and the Philistines. However, it was much later, when David had become king, that God eliminated the Philistine threat for good. This inspires a song of praise, a gratitude that cannot keep quiet. Remembering what God has done for us, we too should not stay silent.
