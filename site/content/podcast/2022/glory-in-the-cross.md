In today's passage Bro. Danny spoke of how we must remind ourselves of the importance of the cross, that it is not just a symbol, it is the place where our sins were forgiven. In this passge Paul spoke to the Galatians about how we need to focus on the fact that God forgave our sins at the cross because of His grace and not because of anything we did.
