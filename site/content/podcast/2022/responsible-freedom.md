This morning, Brother Danny shared with us from the book of Galatians chapter 5, verses 13 through 16.  In this passage, the Apostle Paul command his readers to follow a different way of servitude.  He reminded them that they would either be slaves to their own nature, slaves to the law (as the Judaizers were teaching them), or they could live the life that Jesus calls all of his followers to: Serving others in love through the power of the Holy Spirit.
