This morning, Brother Danny shared with the congregation from the first 11 verses of Galatians chapter 4. In this passage, the Apostle Paul used the example of roman children to demonstrate to the Galatians that going back to the slavery to the Law, and their inability to keep it was akin to a grown adult seeking to put themselves back under the authority of their parent's guardian's authority, in effect, throwing away their freedom. For the Christian to try to "earn" their righteousness, by adherence to the law would be placing themselves back in the condition of being lost.  Praise God that His righteousness is sufficient for our salvation!
