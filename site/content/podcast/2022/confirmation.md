This morning, Brother Danny continues to guide us through the book of Galatians, chapter 1, verses 18-24.  In this passage, we see three truths concerning the faithful in Christ.  First, the faithful know the wisdom of being connected to other believers. The Christian life is a life of community with others.  Secondly, the faithful understand the importance of continuing service.  The Christian life does not have a retirement plan.  And finally, the faithful are confirmed by their actions and beliefs as they work together.
