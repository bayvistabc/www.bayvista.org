Today Brother Bill joined us once once again to lead us through the book of John. Today's message was taken from chapter 2 verses 1 through 12. This passage tells the story of how Jesus turned the water into wine at the wedding in Cana. One important thing to note is that Jesus respectfully told Mary how He was now following God's will and not her's. We all need to remember, that when it comes to authority, God should be our number 1.
