This monring, Brothr Danny begins a new series for us, going through the book of Galatians.  In the first five verses of this book, Paul paints a picture that there is something dreadfully wrong with the churches in Galatia that needs to be addressed.  First, Paul answers what was most likely a challenge to his authority as an Apostle of Jesus Christ.  Second, Paul spells out the heart of the gospel to his readers. Finally, Pauls introduction to this letter is a clear call to give glory to God alone.
