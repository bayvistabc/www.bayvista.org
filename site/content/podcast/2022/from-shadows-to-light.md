This morning, Brother Danny shared with us from all four gospels, as well as other passages, as we all followed the tragedy of Good Friday and the crucifixion of Jesus to the joyous discover of the empty tomb on resurrection morning.  For those who have Jesus as their Lord and Savior, we also have a tale of moving from the shadows of death into the light of our salvation!
