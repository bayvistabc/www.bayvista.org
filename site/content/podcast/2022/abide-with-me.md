Today we continue to go through looking at 'Great Hymns of Our Faith'. This morning Bro. Danny told us the story of how the song 'Abide With Me' was written by Henry F. Lyte. This song is a reminder to us that we need to be constantly asking God to be with us as we go throughout our lives in this sinful world in which we live.
