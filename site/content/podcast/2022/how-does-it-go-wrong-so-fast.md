This week, as Brother Danny continues to share from the Book of Galatians, we look at chapter 1, verses 6 through 10.  In this passage, Paul cuts right to the heart of the matter with the churches in Galatia; and the lesson is one we ought to pay attention to as well.  Some people will try to throw the church into confusion.  False teachers are not just a warning from the past, they can be found throughout the church today as well.  With that idea we must not lose sight of God's Word, if we are to avoid being easy prey.  Finally, we must never forget that a desire to chase the spectacular or new teaching will lead to spiritual disaster.
