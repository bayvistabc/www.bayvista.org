Today as we continue through the book Galatians Bro. Danny spoke of the how the nature of the the flesh is destructive. We must constantly be vigilant so as to not fall in the desires of the flesh, such as sexual immorality, impurity, and debauchery. Our best protection against these things is the Fruit of the Spirit found in verses 22-23.
