Today, as we continue our journey through the book of Galatians, Bro. Danny brought us a wonderful message of how we must be good examples of the way that we, as humans, should live our lives. This passage tells us how we will reap what we sow. One thing that we need to remember about this passage is that it reminds us that we must sow the good news into the world so that one day we may see a bountiful harvest.
