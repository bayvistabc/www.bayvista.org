This morning, Brother Danny shares with us from the book of Galatians, chapter 3.  In verses 6 through 9, the Apostle Paul lets his readers know, in the face of the Judaizers, that we can look back to the example of Abraham to demonstrate that God's plan of salvation for Jew and Gentile is grace through faith, and that it has remained unchanged throughout history.
