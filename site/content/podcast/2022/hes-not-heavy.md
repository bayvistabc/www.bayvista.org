This morning, as Brother Danny leads us through Galations 6:1-6, he shows us Paul's command to bear one another's burdens.  In this the Apostle Paul is commanding and commending his readers to a life of service and empathy towards our fellow believers.  This is how we testify to the world that belong to the Lord Jesus Christ.
