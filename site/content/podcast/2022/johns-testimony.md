This week Bro. Bill spoke of the testimony of John the Baptizer. In todays passage the pharisees and sadducees spoke to John asking who he was to have the authority to call the nation to baptism. Shortly thereafter as he was baptizing the people John saw Jesus approaching him and called out declaring that Jesus was the son of God.
