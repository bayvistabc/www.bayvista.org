In today's message, Brother Danny shared the importance of unity in the body of Christ, using the text from Galatains 2:6-10.  In this passage, we can see the truth that when the church is united IN CHRIST, there are no superstars in the kingdom.  All members are important to the mission of the kingdom.  As we each work to fulfil our role and our calling in the kingdom, we will find an increase in compassion for others.
