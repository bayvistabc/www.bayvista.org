This morning, Bill shares with us the importance of following Jesus' call in our lives.  Using the examples of Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathaniel, as well as examples from his own life, he shows that, while Jesus may call us into paths that we never would have expected for our lives, it is important to remember that he will always walk with us when we respond to his call.
