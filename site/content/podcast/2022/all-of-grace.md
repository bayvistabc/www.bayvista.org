As we continue to read through the book of Galatians Brother Danny spoke of salvation by grace through faith. Pual in this book spoke of how no one could be justified by keeping the law and that he had been "crucified with Christ." As we go thruoghout our lives we need to remember that we are new creatures in Christ.
