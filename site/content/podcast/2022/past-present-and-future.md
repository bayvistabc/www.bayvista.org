This Sunday, as we celebrate the Lord's Supper, Brothr Danny reminds us of three important facts about this celebration.  First, the Lord's Supper points to a real past event.  In this ceremony, Jesus used the elements of the supper to point to his coming act of atonement.  When we come to this table, we remember the sacrifice that Jesus made.  Secondly, the Lord's Supper suggests a present reality: We are in communion with the rest of the body of Christ, RIGHT NOW.  And finally, The Lord's Supper promises a future hope that will be realized when we partake of the marriage feast of the Lamb, and this ordinance will no longer be necessary.
