This morning, Brother Bill began a series with the church through the Gospel of John, starting with the prologue in verses 1 through 18.  In these verses John the Apostle lays out the introduction to his Gospel, and sets forth for his reader the truth of who Jesus is.  This Jesus, the Word of God, offers mankind the opportunity to become the children of God, if they believe in him.
