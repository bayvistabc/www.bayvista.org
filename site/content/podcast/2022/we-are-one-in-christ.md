This morning, Brother Danny used Galatians 3:26-29 to remind the church that we are one in Christ.  For those who have accepted Jesus in faith, who are saved by God's grace, are His childre.  God does not play favorites, not does he show partiality.  We, the people of God, need to stop acting like our external distinctions make us better than someone else, when in God's family, there is no degree of separation between his children.
