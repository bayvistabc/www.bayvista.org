This morning, Brother Danny continued leading us through the book of Galatians, chapter 5, verses 1 mthrough 6.  In this passage, the Apostle Paul teaches his readers that because of our salvation through Christ, we are free from bondage to the law, bondage to sin, and bondage to guilt.  We should celebrate that we are no longer slaves to the curse of sin.  We should also heed the dire warning against legalism or licentiousness in our lives.  We can live free through our faith in Jesus Christ.
