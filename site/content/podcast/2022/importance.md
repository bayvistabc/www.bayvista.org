Today Bro. Danny reminded us of the last supper and how important and meaningful it is. This message reminds us of how we sould rejoice that God loved us so much that He let His only son die for our mistakes. We need to remember going forward that communion is not just a time of fellowship, but a time of remembrance and praise for what He did.
