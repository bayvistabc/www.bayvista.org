As we celebrated the Lord's supper today, Brother Danny remined us of Paul's first letter to the church at Corinth. Paul spoke of how the church at Corinth was becoming divided and was treating the Lord's supper no longer as the time of rememberence that it should but rather they were treating it as a time to feast while others starved.
