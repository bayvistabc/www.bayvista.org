Faith is the focus of the third Sunday of Advent. John the Baptist proclaimed that someone else was coming who was more powerful than he was, and that while John was baptizing with water, this One would baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. This is a promise that can be believed, especially since it has already come to pass!
