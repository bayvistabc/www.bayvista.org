What's for supper? This is a question we've all asked at one point in our lives. Today, we take an in-depth look at the Lord's Supper, where Jesus added meaning to the Passover meal, and what it should mean to us.

_(NOTE: The service had various musical interludes while we partook of the Lord's Supper; this sermon does not have any of that music.)_
