In the churches around Ephesus, there was a wall between the Jews and the Gentiles. Paul points out that the wall separating them from one another was actually a wall separating them from God. Since Christ has torn down the wall separating them from Him, they should no longer have a wall between one another; He had made them (and has made us) one.
