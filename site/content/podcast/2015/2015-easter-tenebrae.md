A Tenebrae service is a service of shadows; as the service progresses, more and more lights are extinguished, until the gathering is in darkness. When done on Maundy Thursday or Good Friday, the service ends there, but on Easter, that's the beginning of the celebration. In the pauses you hear in this recording, there were songs* sung; those had to be removed for copyright reasons. The effect will not be the same, but we pray that you will prayerfully reflect on the sacrifice Christ made through His death and crucifixion, and celebrate His victory over death with us.
