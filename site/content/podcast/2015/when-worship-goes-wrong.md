God established the sacrificial system for Israel, along with its rituals. Over time, they were still doing the rituals, but those rituals had become their focus, not the One to whom the rituals were to point them. By looking at God's rebuke to them through the prophet Isaiah, we see how we can get back to true worship, if ours has drifted into meaningless motion the way Israel's had.
