As Brother Danny takes us through this portion of chapter 2, we are reminded of the statement Jesus made to his disciples: "if you love me, you will keep my commandments."  In this passage, John makes it quite clear that those who know and love God will be obedient (not perfectly, but on a growing curve) and will demon strate that obedience through our love for others.
