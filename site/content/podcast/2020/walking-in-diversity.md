In the passage we studied last week, Paul emphasized unity in Christ. In the verses immediately following, though, he also focuses on the diversity that exists within the Body of Christ, the church. All gifts are given by God, and should be used to build His church; and, while we may have different gifts, we should value all of them, and realize that none of us are non-essential parts of the Body.
