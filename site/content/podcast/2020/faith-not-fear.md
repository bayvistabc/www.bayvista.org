As we look at the first 8 verses of Hebrews this morning, the author reminds us that, in order to live out the life that God has planned for each one of His children, we need to put off the weights of fear, anxiety, and hesitation, and we need to shed the sins that tie themselves around our feet.  Then we need to prepare to have endurance while we run, so we should look at the life of Jesus, who gave all he had for the joy of doing the will of the Father.
