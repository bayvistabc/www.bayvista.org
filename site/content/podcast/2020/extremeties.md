As Brother Danny takes us through the passage this week, we see John's desire that his dear children, the intended audience of his letter, not conitinue to live lives of sin.  However, when the believer does sin, they should not despair, but remember that they have an advocate in Jesus, who is faithful to forgive those sins.
