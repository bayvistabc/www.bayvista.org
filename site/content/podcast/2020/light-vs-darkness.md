Brother Danny shares 1 John 1, verses 5 through 10 this morning.  In this passage John deals with the truth that Christians have to choose whether to live in darkness, or live in the light.  The first principle in our text is that God is pure light, there is no darkness in Him, at all.  The second principle is that mankind has a problem (sin) that must be overcome, and that can only come by the third principle.  God's forgiveness enables us ot walk in the light.
