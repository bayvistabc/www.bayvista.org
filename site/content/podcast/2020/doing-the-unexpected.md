As brother Danny continues walking us through the prophecy of Habakkuk, this morning we are reminded that God does things that sometimes don't make sense tous, as His people.  He may (and often does) use calamity, suffering, and hardship to trun His people from their own stiff-necked understanding and ways and turn them back to him.
