As Brother Danny continues leading us through Habakkuk's prophecy, he reminds us of three principles from Habakkuk's writing that will get us through those situations when it's just not fair.  First, we need to hold onto the basic principles of our faith; remembering that God's characvter never changes.  Second, we must be willing to have a much-neded conversation with God; not just a safe prayer, and not just a list of ailments.  Finally, We need to keep our hope in the God who responds to our cries for help.  Even when things are not fair in this world, we serve the One who always brings about the best for those who love Him.
