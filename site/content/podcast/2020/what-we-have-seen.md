Brother Danny takes us into the book of 1st John this morning, with a look at John's introduction in verses one through four.  In these passages, John prepares his readers to defend against the coming gnostic heresy which eats away at the core of Christianity.  In our time, this warning is just as important, as there is much confusion about Jesus Christ.  As in John's day, we have to remember that true fellowship within the body is impossible apart from the source of that fellowship, whcih is Jesus.  That fellowship can become a fountain of real joy in our lives.
