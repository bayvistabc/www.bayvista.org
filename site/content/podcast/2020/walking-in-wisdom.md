Paul wraps up his discussion of putting off and putting on by looking at the wisdom of God. We must pay attention to things that happen around us; we must discern the will of God; we must yield ourselves to the right control (His); and we must allow our hearts to be filled with the wonder of God, to the point where we cannot help but sing His praises.
