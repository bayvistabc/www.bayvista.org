As Brother Danny wraps up Paul's introduction in the book of Ephesians, he reminds us that our salvation was planned by God before the foundation of the world.  Gentiles were not "plan b" in the  kingdom of God.  Also, he shows us that it is Jesus the Son who makes the gospel of salvation, and the fulfillment  of God's plan, possible.  Finally, we have the presence of the Holy Spirit as the downpayment of our salvation and the glory which we will recieve.  In this the whole Godhead is present, and our response should be praise and worship.
