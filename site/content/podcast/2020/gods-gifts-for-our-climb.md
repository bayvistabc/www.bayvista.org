As Brother Danny concludes our study off the Book of Habakkuk with chapter 3, verse 19, he shows us three principles from this one passage, two which are explicit in the text and one that is inferred by the text.  The first principle is that God grants His children a source of strength for their journey.  The second explicit principle of the text is that God grants His children stability for their path.  And finally, As Habakkuk noted the musical conditions for this work to be sung in corporate worship, God grants His children a call to guide others as we travel along the path.
