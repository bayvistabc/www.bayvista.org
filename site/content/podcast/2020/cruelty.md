As Brother Danny continues leading us through the book of Habakkuk, we look at verses 12 through 17 of chapter 2 this morning.  Woes to the cruel.  In this passage, God's prophet pronounces calamity against the Babylonians for their cruelty to their enemies.  There are three aspects of this cruelty that are called out by the prophet.  The first aspect of cruelty comes from our selfish desires.  The second comes from our mocking heart.  The third from the human thirst for violence.  However, lest we think that these woes do not apply to believers, Brother Danny also shares scripture written specifically to the church that talks about the same issues.
