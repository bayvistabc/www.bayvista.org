This morning, as Brother Danny continues leading us through Paul's letter to the Ephesian Christians, we look at this passage often referred to as "The Armor of God."  As Danny looks at each of the Elements of this armor, he reminds us that we are not expected to fight spiritual battles in our own strength.  Rather, we are to trust in the all sufficient strength of our Father.  Additionally, we are to use the armor that God has provided us in order to withstand the assault that will come as we walk in obedience to Christ.  And finally, we are not to neglect the importance of praying for those who walk beside us in the battle as well.  When all is said and don, the Christian is commanded to STAND!
