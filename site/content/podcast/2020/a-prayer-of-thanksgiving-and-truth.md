As Brother Danny continues taking us through the book of Ephesians, he shares chapter 1, verses 15-23 this morning.  In these verses, Paul expresses his prayer of thanksgiving for the Ephesian believers.  Paul thanked God for their growth, their love for other, and their love for God.  As we examine this prayer of Paul's, it would be healthy to consider whether our lives would inspire such a prayer from Paul.
