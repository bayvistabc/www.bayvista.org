As we celebrate the fourth Sunday of Advent, Brother Danny reminds us of God's steadfast love towards his children.  This love is what brings us hope as we await the return of our Savior.  This love is what gives us the peace that surpasses all understanding.  Thils love brings us joy in the darkest of times.  And this love is made manifest in Jesus Christ alone!
