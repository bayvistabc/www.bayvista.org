This morning, Brother Danny takes us through Habakkuk chapter 3, verses 16-18.  In these passages, Habakkuk gives us three lessons regarding our faith.  The first lesson is that waiting quietly on the Lord can result in a heart of hope.  The second lesson is that when we are honest about our circumstances can cause us to rely on the Lord.  Finally, when we remember who God is, we can have joy in the toughest of times.
