After completing his instruction on putting off and putting on, Paul shifts to another theme, that of mutual submission among believers. He begins with his thesis - "submit to one another in love" - and continues by looking at the implications for several human relationships. The first up is husband and wife, and Paul starts by expressing how that looks from the wife's perspective. Many in the faith have taken these verses to mean things that they do not mean; Bro. Danny explains how submission is a must in the lives of all believers, and how biblical submission is neither about inferiority nor force.
