Looking into 1 Corinthians 11, Brother Bill shares with us the importance of being mindful of the unity of the church as we approach the Lord's table.  Paul had admoinished the Corinthian church about their divisions effecting the mission of the church, and we need to be cautious not to have that same issue in the life our congregations.
