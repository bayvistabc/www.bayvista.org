Following Paul's thought that Christian relationships ought to be built on a foundation of mutual submission and love, Brother Danny shares with the church from Ephesians chapter 5, verses 25-33.  In this passage Paul explains to his readers that, in the marriage relationship, husbands are commanded to sacrificially choose to demonstrate love towards their wives in an active way.  There is no room for tyranny or selfishness when you model your love after the love of Christ for the church.
