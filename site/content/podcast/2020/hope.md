On this first Sunday of Advent, Brother Danny explains the hope that we have as God's children.  We have hope that God hears us when we cry out for help.  We have hope that God's anger does not last forever.  And most importantly, we have hope that God has provided a means by which we can be renewed -- a promised deliverer, Jesus the Son of Man.
