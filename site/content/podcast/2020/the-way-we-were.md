As Brother Danny takes us into chapter 2 of Paul's letter to the Ephesian believers, he explains Paul's statment in verse 1 of chapter 2 that all believers were, at the first, dead in ther sins.  There is nothing they, or we, could do to effect our salvation.  Without Christ, we would be doomed to a life of slavery.  But, through an act of mercy, God reached out and changed us through His Son, Jesus Christ.  Because of this salvation, believers everywhere should commit to letting our lives and our voices proclaim the good news wherever we go.
