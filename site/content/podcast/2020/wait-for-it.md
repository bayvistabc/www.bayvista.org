As Brother Danny continues leading us through the prophecy of Habakkuk, this week's focus is on the suficiency of God's revelation.  God's revelation speaks to His purpose in this world, in His timeline.  Since His revelation is true, it is trustworthy, and will come to pass, though it requires us to have patience.  As we let God work his purpose in our lives, we must also exercise faithfulness while we wait for His plan to come to fruition.
