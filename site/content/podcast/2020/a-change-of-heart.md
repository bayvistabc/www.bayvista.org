As Brother Danny takes us into the third chapter of Habakkuk, we see a change of heart in the prophet, from the angry and indignant questioning of the first two chapters to the heartfelt plea for mercy that we find here in chapter three.  In these first tow verses of the chapter, we learn that God is instrumental in this change of heart, by three actions: First, by making Himself known through his word.  Second, by the work that He does in our lives.  Third, God changes our hearts by humbling us and leading us to desire mercy for others.
