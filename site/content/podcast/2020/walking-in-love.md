Paul continues his theme of putting off and putting on by listing some of the sinful activities the Ephesian church was doing, and what they should do instead. The unloving actions were causing the world to question their faith, but by reorienting themselves to God's purpose, they could begin living for Him. Paul calls us all to imitate God by walking in love.
