As we continue through Paul's letter to the Ephesians, Paul continues his look at the Christian life and how it correlates to our relationships, today with the emphasis on the parent-child relationship.  Even though the original readers of Paul's letter would have been very familiar with the concept parental authority, Paul reminds these Christian children that is it right to obey their parents "in the Lord." He also advises parents to not lay expectations and standards upon their children that would drive them to anger and wrath, and could potentially drive them away from serving Jesus.
