** Note ** There is a break in audio at the 29 minute mark, as the Pastor's microphone batteries died. ** Note **
This morning, Brother Danny wraps up his exposition of Paul's letter to the Ephesian believers with a look at Paul's closing statements.  After all that Paul has taught in this letter, it is obviousl that he desires not only this church, but all of the churches to reach out and care for one another, to help bear each other's burdens, and to show love to our fellow believers as we labor for the kingdom of God.  May we all follow this admonition.
