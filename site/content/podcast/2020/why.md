This morning, Brother Danny begins an exposition on the Prophecy given to Habakkuk, beginning with the first four verses of chapter 1.  In these verses, we learn that there are times of apparent silence from God, and that sometimes we struggle with understanding how and why God allows evil to go unpunished, and his people to suffer.  But we also learn that God is always working for the best for his people, no matter how much we have been disobedient and hard-hearted ourselves.  God has not left us without hope.
