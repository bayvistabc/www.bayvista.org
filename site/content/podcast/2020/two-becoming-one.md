In the tradition of those who followed God, when Jesus came, there were two divisions - the Jews, who were on the inside as God's chosen people; and Gentiles, who were everyone else. Paul tells the church at Ephesus that these two divisions no longer exist, because Jesus Christ has torn them down. His death is the instrument that brings us peace, and through Him, we can find wholeness and move beyond the barriers our world continues to erect today.
