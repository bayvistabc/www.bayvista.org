This secon d Sunday of Advent, Brother Danny reminds us of the Peace of God which surpasses all understanting.  Along with the Psalmist, we can remember the testimony of God's dealings with His people.  Through the Psalms, we can hear the God's promise of peace for His people.  Because of that we can rest in the assurance of God's character in dealing with his people.  And because of His character, we can embrace the truth of God's blessing upon His people.
