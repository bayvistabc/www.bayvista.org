We have celebrated the first coming of our Savior this week, but our preparation  and celebration for the second coming of Christ continues.  This  morning, Brother Danny reminds us that the phrase "Praise the Lord" in scripture is a plural imperative phrase.  In other words it is a command to all creation to praise God.  As we look at Psalm 148, remember to Praise the Lord!
