In this morning's message, Brother Danny explains what Paul means when he says that we are in Jesus.  Being in Jesus means that we are redeemed, paid for, at a very high price.  Being in Jesus means that we are forgiven, the wall of sin is destroyed.  Finally, being in Jesus means that we are part of His plan.  From the foundations of the world, God had a plan for each of his children.
