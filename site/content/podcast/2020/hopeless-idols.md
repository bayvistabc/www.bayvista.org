This morning, Brother Danny shares with us two verses that are seen, not only in Habakkuk, but visible in every book of the Bible.  Over and over, God's people are warned away from idolatry, and over and over, we can see that warning is ignored, at our own peril.  Even though we may not carve idols from wood or cast them from gold, the idols of work, relationships, money, and power can and do often lead us astray.
