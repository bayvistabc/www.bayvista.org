In a very timely message following hurricane Zeta's landfal on the Gulf Coast, Brother Danny shares with us from the book of 1 John, chapter 2.  In this message we are reminded, as God's children, that we can and should know that we are forgiven, that our relationship with God can grow deeper than we ever thought possible, and that no matter the storms of life that come against us, we have the strength to stand firm.  Most importanly, the Christian should rest in the knowledge that we are the Lord's!
