As we celebrate this third week of Advent, we focus on the theme of Joy.  Our joy comes from God's act of renewal, not from our circumstance.  His renewal brings our delight, it makes our testimony joyful, and it b rings a feeling of relief and refreshment to our hearts.  As we prepare to celebrate the first coming of Christ, and we prepare our hearts for His second coming, let us show the world the Joy that comes from knowing our Saviour.
