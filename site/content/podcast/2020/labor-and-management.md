As Brother Danny concludes Paul's discussion about Christian relationships, we cover an especially pertinent passage in chapter 6, verses 5-9.  In this passage Christian bondservants (slaves, workers) are admionished to remember that their true master is Christ.  Likewise, Christian masters (owners, employers) are also admonished to remember that the Lord is master of their lives as well, and Christians are calld to be different than the world in the way they treat others.
