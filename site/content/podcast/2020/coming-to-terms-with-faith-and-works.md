Brother Danny continues taking us through Paul's letter to the Ephesians, today in chapter 2, verses 8 through 10.  In these verses, Paul expresses first the nature of our salvation; that God alone is responisble for every aspect of our salvation.  Second, Paul wants his readers to understand how dear we are to the Author of our salvation.  As His masterpieces, God looks at us with love and joy.  Finally, Paul explains that the Christian isn't merely saved FROM something; as Christians, we are saved FOR the good works that God has prepared for us to do.
