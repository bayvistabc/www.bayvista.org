Brother Danny takes us further through the third chapter of Habakkuk this morning, with a message of hope.  In our passage for today, Habakkuk recals the mighty deliverance of God as he brought his people from their bondage in Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the promised land.  With his eye on God's faithfulness in the past, he turns his eye towards the future and God's continued promise of deliverance for his people.  Likewise, we can look back on the finished work of Christ and know that, as Paul says in Philippians, he who began a good work in you will see it through to completion!
