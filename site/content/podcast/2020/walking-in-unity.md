As Paul pivots from doctrine to application, he begins by underscoring the importance of the church living in unity. He explains several aspects of this unity: that it is crucial to our living the lives to which God has called us; how it requires humility; how we should strive for peace; and how our living in unity reflects the work God has done in our lives.
