This morning, as Brother Danny continues leading us through the the book of Habakkuk, our focus is on chapter 2, verses 5 through 11.  In this passage, God's prophet warns the Chaldeans (Babylon) against the danger of arrogant pride, or hubris.  But, before we can say that the warning doesn't apply to us, we should also note that there are many places in God's word where this same warning is given to God's people.  An attitude of Hubris refelcts a mindset of arrogance, leads to the exploitation of others, and ultimately results in a shame filled judgement on the one who is so arrogantly prideful.  May this sin be far from the people of God.
