In our message from the Book of Ephesians this morning, Brother Danny explains what Paul means in chapter 2, verses 11 through 13.  As Paul has just concluded his exclamation that believers are God's masterpiece, he goes on to explain that, though the Gentiles were once NOT in covenant with God, were once NOT in relationship with God, by His will and through His Son, they are now His people.  And, just as those Gentiles in Ephesus have been adopted into God's family, so have we.
