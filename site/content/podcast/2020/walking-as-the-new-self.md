Paul reminds the church at Ephesus that they are not who they once were; they are new creations in Christ. He reminded them that their prior way of living was contrary to what God wanted them to do, and that they had been given a new identity. They needed (and we need) to realize that this transformation must be intentional; we are not helpless to resist the draw of our old selves, but we must resist if we are to be who God wants us to be.
