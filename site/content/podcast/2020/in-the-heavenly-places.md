Brother Danny explains the opening benediction in the book of Ephesians, beginning with verses 3 through 6.  In these verses, Paul gets caught up in expressing the greatness of God's love for his people.  Before the foundations of the world, God chose his people for adoption into the family of God.  With that adoption comes the command to be set apart, holy for God's plan.  This doctrine of elections shouldn't be something that God's people ignore, rather it should cause us to glorify God even more fully.
