Today, Brother Danny shares with us from Ephesians 1:1-2, a passage that is often overlooked for anything of spiritual significance.  This salutation from Paul to the churches in and around Ephesus, serves as a reminder for us that God calls us into His purpose to live as saints, holy ones set apart.  We are called to be set apart for the service that he commands of us, a service to reach the lost with the gospel of Jesus Christ.  And he equips us with the community of the church, to uplift and encourage each believer.
