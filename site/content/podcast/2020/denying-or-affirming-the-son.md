In our message today, Brother Danny reminds us that not everyone who claims to be of Christ, actually is.  This means that we need to be reliant on the Holy Spirit to lead us to the truth about Christ, we must hold tightly to the truth of the Gospel of Christ, and We need to heed the call, repeated often in scripture, to remain true to Christ.
