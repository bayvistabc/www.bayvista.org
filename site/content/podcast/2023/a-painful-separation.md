Today Bro. Danny shared with us from the book of Genesis what happened to Ishmael, Abraham's son borne by Hagar. In this passage Abraham sends Hagar and Ismael away and God tells Hagar that He will make a great nation of Ishmael. This passage serves to remind us that, when we fail to trust God, our relationship with Him is put at risk.
