Today's sermon was brought to us today by Bro. Bill Collum. In this sermon he told us that John the Baptist moved to a town called Aenon to presumably continue baptizing people in God's name. The reason John would have had to do this is because during the dry season the Jordan river does not flow as swiftly and Aenon had many natural springs that he could use.
