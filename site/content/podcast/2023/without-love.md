This morning Brother Danny shared with the congregation the importance of love in the Christian life using 1 Corinthians Chapter 13, verses 1-3.  In this passage, Paul makes it abundantly clear that without love, our actions are meaningless, our Christian lives are meaningless, and our witness about Christ are meaningless.  For the Christian to live without love is an oxymoron of the greatest degree.  Do you show love in your life?
