Today we light the third Candle of Advent, the Candle of Joy. In today's sermon Brother Danny told us of God's gift of joy that can seem to be too good to be true. In the world today there is much hate and negativity that is passed around, but we as God's children should  share the news of God's love and everlasting joy with everyone we meet.
