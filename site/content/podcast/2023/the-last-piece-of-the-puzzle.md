In today's sermon Bro. Danny spoke of how God finally affirmed Sarai as the woman of whom would bear the child of promise to Abraham. Sometimes we are foolish like Abraham and don't believe that what God has said could possibly be true, but we need to trust in God that He will be faithful to His word.
