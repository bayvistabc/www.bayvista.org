Israel had been taken captive - the northern kingdom by Assyria, the southern kingdom by Judah. Jeremiah prophesied a return for the southern kingdom, but he also prophesied of a coming King unlike any they had seen up to this point - a righteous, fair ruler Who would bring safety and salvation to His people.
