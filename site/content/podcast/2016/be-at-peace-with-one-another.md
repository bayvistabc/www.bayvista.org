The early Christians were known as such by their love for one another; in fact, Jesus even said that this would be a hallmark of His disciples. However, we are often known more for what we are against, including - at times - each other. Paul encourages us, through his letter to the church in Rome, to live at peace with one another, and to accept them the way Christ has accepted us.
