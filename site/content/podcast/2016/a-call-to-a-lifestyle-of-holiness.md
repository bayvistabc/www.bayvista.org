Holiness is a concept that is probably skewed in our minds. Far from just an outside appearance, holiness is a commitment of the heart, mind, and actions, and has been commanded of God's followers since the early days of the Old Testament. Peter emphasizes to the "church under fire" that we must focus on holiness.
