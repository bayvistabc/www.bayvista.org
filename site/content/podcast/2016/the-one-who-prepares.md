When John the Baptist was born, Zechariah (his father) was able to speak for the first time in 9 months. Some of his first words were a prophecy of both his son and the One for Whom his son was sent to prepare the world. Like John, Christ should be the focus of our lives, and we too are called to bring light and peace into a dark and tumultuous world.
