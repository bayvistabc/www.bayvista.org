When the instruments of an orchestra are tuned together, and their players follow the conductor, there is great harmony; what happens before the tune-up, though, is more like a cacophony. Peter describes the way Christians should relate to the world by using the word "harmony;" how are we to be harmonious in this cacophonous world?
