This morning, Brother Danny shares with us the "what if" when God renews our hearts. If we are honest and observe the condition of our un-renewed heart, we will find that it is divided, it is stubborn and refuses to bend, and it is yielded to disobedience.  We need to ask God to renew our heart, make it sigularly focused on the will of God, to soften it and make it plable to God's word, and to strengthen it, to make it resist the tempations to sin and go our own way.
