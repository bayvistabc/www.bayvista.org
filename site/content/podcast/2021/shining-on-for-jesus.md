Thank you for bearing with our technical difficulties.  This morning, Brother Danny shared the final message in the "Why Are We Here" series, with a look at Matthew 5:14-16.  In this very familiar passage, Christians are reminded that we are a light that can make a difference in this world.  We are a light, because of Christ in us.  Thus, that light should never be hidden.  We cannot be effective as gospel light-bearers if we withdraw from the world.  And finally, letting our light shine in this world will bring glory to God, by letting the world see what a difference christ makes in our lives.
