This morning, Brother Danny shared with us from the Book of Hosea, the call for repentance for God's people.  There are three key points to this message.  First, in order to have real repentance, one must have real awareness of sin.  We have have to realise that sin isn't merely a mistake, it is a crippling problem.  Second, real repentance requires more than platitudes of apology.  It must come from a contrite heart.  Finally, we need to be assured that real repentance is not something we do on our own, but is something that can only take place by the grace of God.
