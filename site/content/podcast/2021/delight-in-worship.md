This morning, Brother Danny shared with us the first 6 verses of Isaiah chapter 12. In these verses, it is important to see that, when awakening comes to the church, we will be able to delight in worship.  Our worship will be marked by gratitude, for what God has done for his people; trust, that he will keepm his promises to his people; and enthustiastic joy as we set our pride aside and we allow ourselves to really worship.  Most of all, Delightful worship is marked by a desire to share that worship with others, that they may come to know the Lord.
