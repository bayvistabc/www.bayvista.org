In this morning's message, Brother Danny encouraged the church to consider if we can say that we have hearts that are given to ministry.  There are three questions for the believer to ask of themselves on a regualr basis:  Are we ready to minister when we see a need?  Does our presence bring gladness? and Does our willing service help others to continue their service.  Every believer should be able to answer these questions with a "yes" if we truly have hearts to minister to others.
