This morning, Brother Danny shared with us from John chapter 4, verses 19 through 24.  In this familiar passage, Jesus shares with the Samaritan woman of Sychar concerning worship.  The worship of the Samaritans was built upon ignorance, focused on a place, and it was a religion based on humanity.  We need to avoid these traps of false worship, an instead, offer the kind of worship that Jesus says is acceptable and God honoring.  When we worship in spirit and in truth, we are fully engaged in the only worship that truly honors God.
