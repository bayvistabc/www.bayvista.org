This morning, Brother Danny shared with us from a wonderful passage in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 19, verses 1through 6, explaining the relvance of worship in the Christian life.  As we study this passage, we can see four important principles about worship that God's people need to hold very closely.  First, Worship serves to remind us that God is Glorious and Powerful.  Second, Worship reminds us that He is True and Just.  Thisrd, Worship serves as a reminder to God's children that Salvation belongs to Our Lord.  And finally, Worship reminds us that our God reigns forever.  Halleluja!
