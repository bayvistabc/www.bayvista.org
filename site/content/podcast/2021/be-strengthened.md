In this morning's service, Brother Bill shares with us the next segment of Hebrews chapter 12.  In verses 12 through 17, the writer of Hebrews, in writing to the scattered Hebrew Christians, encouraged them to strengthen themselves and push onward with the work that Jesus has given for the church to do.  There is no doubt that it will be hard, no question that it is arduous; but there is a guarantee that it is worthwhile.
