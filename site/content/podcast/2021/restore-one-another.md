This morning, Brother Danny wrapped up his segment on fellowship within the church, with a message about our role as ministers of restoration.  In order to be successful in that ministry, first we must not clothe ourselves in the in the ways of the world.  Paul calls the Colosian believers to put off things like anger and envy and strife and to be clothed instead with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.  When those are the characteristics that show in our lives, the way we treat one another will be different.  This leads us to the ability to forgive one another, and to restore our relationships to where they ought to be.
