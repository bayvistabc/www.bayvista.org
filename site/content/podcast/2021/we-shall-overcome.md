Today, brother Danny shares with us three elements that lead us to victory from 1 John 5.  The first of those elements is our commitment to Christ.  Without faith in the  life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, there is no victory to be had.  The second element that leads to victory is true love.  This is love for our God and love for our brothers and sisters in Christ.  Without love, we  have to question if we have faith.  The final element that leads us to victory is a lifestyle of obedience.  We don't  work ourselves to salvation, but our salvation works its way out in our lives.  If we have that faith, love, and obedience, we shall overcome!
