In our message, Brother Danny shares with us what it means to live a life of righteousness.  Living in righteousness requires us to understand the very serious nature of sin.  If we treat sin in a casual manner, we will never react to it as seriously as we should.  That reaction should be a rejection of sin's hold on our lives.  Though the Christian had eternal security, that cannot cause us to become comfortable with sin.  Finally, the only way we can live a righteous life, is to fully surrender to God's power in our lives.  No amount of willpower will be suficient to bring us where we need to be.  Only God can deliver us into that life of righteousness.
