This morning, Brother Danny continued with his series on "Why are we here" looking at 2 Timothy, Chapter 2, Verses 20 through 22.  In this small passage, Paul reminds his readers that one of the ways we honor God is by living sanctified lives.  While sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives, our cooperation with the Spirit is what makes that sanctification effective.  We also honor God by being useful in the kingdom.  Our usefullness is directly related to our sanctification.  Finally, we honor God when we are prepared to serve, when He wants us to serve.  We need to recognize that all believers have been called to serve.
