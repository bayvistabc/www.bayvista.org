This week, Brother Danny reminds us that there is no room for hatred in the life of the Christian.  Hatred is a mark of evil, and it is not an acceptable reaction for a child of God.  When hatred raises its head, we must turn from it.  Love, on the other hand, is at the heart of the Gospel message.  Loving God's family, loving other people, is one way that we can have assurance of our own eternal life.  Let us eagerly embrace the call to love one another.
