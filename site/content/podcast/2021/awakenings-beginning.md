Today, Brother Danny takes us through 2 Chronicles chapter 34, to show three principles of Awakening that must take place in our lives.  The first of which is that only God's word can convict us of the need for awakening in our spiritiual lives.  Once that conviction begins to take place, God's people begin to influence others to awaken.  Finally, as awakening grows withing the people of God, we will sense a growing need to turn away from the things that can hinder our spiritual walk.  Once we renew our passion for the full counsel of God's word, and we allow God to work in and through each of us, the church will not be the same.
