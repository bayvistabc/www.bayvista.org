This week, Brother Danny answers the ubiquitous question, "What is love?"  In John's letter, the answwer to that is clear.  Love is laying down your life for the sake of someone else.  To put it another way, love is seeking the absolute best for someone, no matter the personal cost.  Jesus showed this for the church in the way he lived his life, and in that he died for the atonement of our sins.  We, the church, need to keep our eyes open to the needs of people around us, and to sacrificially meet those needs, just like Jesus did.
