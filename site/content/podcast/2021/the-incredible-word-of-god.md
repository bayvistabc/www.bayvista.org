This morning, Brother Danny shared with us a beautiful passage from Psalm 119, verses 9 through 16.  In this passage the Psalmist wrote about the Incredible Word of God.  We are reminded the the Word of God brings power for the believer in times of temptation.  As we read and study God's Word, it changes our hearts, and enables us to stand in the face of the assaults of the world.  God's Word brings joy to the heart of the believer.  As we spend time in the Word, we are reminded of God's fathfulness in keeping His promises to His children.  Finally, the Word brings wisdom into the life of the believer.  As we encounter God in His Word, we are shown how to live a life that is pleasing to Him.
