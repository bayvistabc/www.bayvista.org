On this morning, as the gulf coast awaited the landfall of Hurricane Ida, Brother Danny's message from Psalm 92 reminds us that we should delight in worshiping our God, no matter our circumstance.  Likewise our worship should not be intermittent.  Rather is should be ongoing, and it should reflect that God is our first priority.  Finally, when we are facing life's storms, our worship will demonstrate that we have been touched by God's greatness.
