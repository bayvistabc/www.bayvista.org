This morning, Brother Danny shared with us one of the most basic aspects of God's nature; God is love.  Everything that he does is motivated by and filled with the Love that he has for his people.  That love is 100%  at God's initiative, and not due to any lovliness on our part.  More than that, God's love came at a heavy price, in that it cost the life of His son, Jesus.
