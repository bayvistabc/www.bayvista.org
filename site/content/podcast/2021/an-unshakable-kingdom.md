This morning, Brother Bill shares with us the conclusion of Hebrews chapter 12.  In verses 18 through 28, the writer of Hebrews concludes his discussion of how the Christian should live, based on the fact that, because of Christ, we are now citizens of a kingdom that will not be shaken, that will not be destroyed, and that will last forever.
