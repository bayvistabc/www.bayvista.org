On this, the fourth Sunday of Advent, we celebrate the Love of God for His people, and the love that we are commanded to share with others.  Brother Danny shares from Malachi chapter 5  this morning, showing how the love of God was shown to man in the act of sending His son to be born in the mosy humble of circumstances, in the tiny, little town of Bethlehem.
