This morning, Brother Danny shares Psalm 96 with us, to help us determine what Whole-Hearted Worship is supposed to look like.  There were four key points to the message this morning:  1. Whole-hearted worship is God-honoring.  We should always be careful to enthusiastically praise God, because He is worthy of all honor.  2. Whole-hearted worship is filled with joy.  Even in the toughest of times, our worship should be filled with notes of joy.  3. Whole-hearted worship is bursting with hope.  We need to gratefully embrace the hope that God offers when the world threatens us with despair.  4. Whole-hearted worship is a pathway to sharing.  We need to share the works of the God that we worship with a world that has no Idea who God is.
