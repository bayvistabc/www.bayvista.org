This morning, Brother Danny shared from John's gospel, chapter 6, verses 1 through 13, the feeding of the 5000.  In this passage, there are some important principles for the believers within the church to hold onto as we minister in our families, in our congregation, and in our communities.  First, we need to recognize that ministry is something we cannot do by ourselves.  We may need other believers, and we always need the Holy Spirit in order to be successful.  Second, we need to assess the resources that we have available for ministry.  We cannot forget that we have the indwelling presence of God to help us as we are obedient.  Finally, we need to remember that God will bless whatever we give for the ministry that He has prepared for us to do.
