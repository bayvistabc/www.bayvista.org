This morning, Brother Danny shares with us how to keep from being gullible.  To make sure we are following only those teachings that agree with the teachings of Jesus, we need to pay close attention to the words of those teachers.  If they contradict God's Word in regard to who Jesus is, If their worldview matches the world more than the Word, and if their teaching does not align with God's word, they do not deserve the attention of God's children.
