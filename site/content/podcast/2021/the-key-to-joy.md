This morning, Brother Danny shared with us the key to joy found in Isaiah chapter 35.  In this passage, there are four promises found for the Christian to hold onto and unlock the joy of the Christian life.  These promises are first, that God's glory will wone day be revealed.  Second, as brothers and sisters in Christ, we have the promise of mutual encouragement.  Third, we have the promise of hope for the possibilities of the future.  Finally, we have the promise of God's continuing grace as we live out our lives awaiting the return of our Lord and Savior.
