This morning, Brother Danny Spoke to us about having the right priorities in our life.  In order to prioritize God first in our lives, we have to be real about the situation that we find oursleves in.  Then we need to acknowledge the consequences of continuing in that situation.  We need to hear God's call on our lives.  And we need to be prepared for God to stir our hearts.
