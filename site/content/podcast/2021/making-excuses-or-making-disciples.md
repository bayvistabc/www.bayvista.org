This morning, on Reformation Day, Brother Bill shared with us the importance of believeing God and obeying His commands as we seek to fulfil the statement found in Romans 1:17 "the righteous shall live by faith."  As we seek to do so, we can be obedient to both the great commandment found in Matthew 22:37-40 and the great commission in Matthew 28:18-20.
