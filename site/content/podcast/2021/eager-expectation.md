In this morning's sermon, Brother Danny helps us to consider how critical it is to our Christian walk to remember who we are, in Christ.  We also need to keep in mind that we should be in the process of growing in Christlikeness.  While those things should be everpresent in the mind of the child of God, it is often very easy to get discouraged.  And so, we need to keep in mind that our metamorphasis into the new creation is only possible by God's grace, and not through our own work.  Ultimately, this is a message of great hope.
