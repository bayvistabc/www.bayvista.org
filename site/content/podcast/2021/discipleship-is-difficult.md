This morning, Brother Danny shared with us the important Message that Paul had for Timothy, recorded in 2 Timothy 2:1-6, that discipleship is difficult.  First, discipleship is only possible by God's grace.  We cannot come to faith through our own efforts, nor can we grow in our relationship with the Lord through our own strength.  It is only by God's grace, and through the power of the Holy Spirit that we can be disciples.  Second, discipleship results in hardship.  Throughout his time with the 12, Jesus repeatedly let them know that being His follower was going to come with difficulty.  Paul taught the same to Timothy and the church.  Finally, because of that hardship, discipleship requires endurance.  By God's grace, and through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, we can endure the hardships and difficulties that are before us in the walk of discipleship.
