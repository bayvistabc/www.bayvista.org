As we begin a new series this morning, Brother Danny shares with us from the Book of Judges, chapter 2, verses 10-19.  In these verses  we see the pattern of the book, and the life of Israel immediately following the conquest of Canaan.  Brother Danny encourges us to consider the cause of stumbling, as it is shown in Judges.  When we fail to acknowledge God, we will suffer calamity.  Rather we must constantly be renewed in our relationship with God.  We must also consider the effect of stumbling.  The human condition says that we WILL serve something.  Only a vital connection with God will fill our lives with meaning.  Finally, there is a solution to the stumbling that our sin will cause.  We will embrace that solution when we take a serious turn toward following God's mercy.
