This Resurrection Sunday, Brother Danny shares three truths  from 1 John Chapter 5 that should cause the Christian to rejoice.  First, Our risen Lord keeps us safe.  Jesus will not allow his followers to be overrun by temptation, He always provides a way of escape.  Second, our risen Lord delivers us from Satan's control.  We cannot be controlled by Satan, and we need not live in fear of the enemy.  Finally, it is only by our Risen Lord that we can have relationship with the Father.  The false gods of this world have nothihng to offer us, we can remain true to the One who is truth.
