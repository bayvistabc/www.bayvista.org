This morning, Brother Danny shares with us God's requirement of love.  As His children we are required to love our brothers and sisters in Christ, the way Jesus loved us.  John tells us that by this, we will show the world what God is like.  Additionally, our witness is effective when our love for others looks like the love that God has for his children.  On the other hand, when we are always contentious and quarrelsome, the world begins to doubt that our God has anything to offer them.
