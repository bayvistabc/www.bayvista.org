This morning, Brother Danny exhorted us to be bringers of profit to one another, taken from the text of 2 Timothy 1:15 through 18.  In this passage, paul talks about the two different kinds of people we encounter in this world: those who bring loss to others and those who bring profit.  People who bring loss are motivated by fear, un willing to risk opening up to others, and so they fail to be faithful.  As Christians, our motivation should be the command of Christ to love one another at all cost, to risk everything for the sake of our brothers and sisters in Christ, and to rely on God's strength to be obedient.
