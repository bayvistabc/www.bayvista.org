This morning, Brother Danny shared from Psalm 92, verses 1 through six, to demonstrate how our personal worship reflects what we really believe about our Lord.  When we have personal worship, it shows that we delight in worshipping our God.  Corporate worship is wonderful, but it should not be the only time we praise God.  When our personal worship is ongoing, it demonstrates how vital it is to our lives.  IF we make a regular practice of praising God in our personal lives, it will change the way we think about worship.  And finally, a consistent and ongoing personal worship will reveal that we have been touched by the greatness of our God.  Even though this is all predicated on haging a personal worship time and practice, it will be shown in the ives that we lead on a daily basis.
