This morning, Brother Danny shared with us the importance of strengthening one another within the church body.  Sometimes, we need help remembering who we are.  We sometimes forget that following Christ should have a practical impact on our lives.  Sometimes, we need help when we feel discouraged.  When we are willing to walk through the valley together demonstrates our love for one another.  And sometimes, we need help when we've been weakened by life's battles.  Every member of the church has a responsibility to help other members grow.
