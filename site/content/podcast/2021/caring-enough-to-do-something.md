This morning, Brother Danny encouraged the church to care enough to do something.  Using the parable of the good Samaritan found in Luke 10, verses 25 through 37, we are encouraged to remember that involved ministry requires us to have hearts of compassion.  In order for the church to be successful at this, we need to turn our hearts over to the Lord.  We must also have a willingness to help "whoever."  Finally, we need to remember that this kind of ministry has a cost, and we need to be willing to pay that cost.
