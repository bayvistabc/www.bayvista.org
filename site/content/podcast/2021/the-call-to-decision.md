This morning, Brother Danny brought us to Joshua 24, verses 14 through 27.  This passage helps us understand that one of the keys to the revival that must come is that we must, individually and repeatedly decide how we will  respond to God's call to decision.  We must choose to take a public stand as a follower of jesus.  This doesn't mean being abrasive or obnoxious in our Christianity, but it does mean that we have to live publicly for Jesus.  We also have to know that this commitment does not come lightly.  There  is a cost to being a disciple of Christ, we must reckon that cost every day.  Finally, we have to follow through with the choice, and by God's grace, we can.
