This morning, Brother Danny xshares with the church the importance of being together as one body.  As Christians, we are no longer outsiders.  Rather, we belong to God's household.  God's household isn't built on shaky ground.  It has the firmest of foundations in the faithfulness of God Himself.  Also, we are not a finished construction.  The church is not a building, or a campus.  It is the called out believers in Jesus Christ, throughout all of human history, regardless of nationality, gender, skin color, or anything else.
