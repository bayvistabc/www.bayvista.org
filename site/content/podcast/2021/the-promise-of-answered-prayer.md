This morning, Brother Danny shares the promise of answered prayer.  John tells his readers very clearly, that we can be confident that God hears our prayers as we pray in His will.  That connection of the believer to the will of God is the essential key to effective prayer.  God answers the prayers that he hears.  As we submit to His will, He responds favorably to our prayers.  Finally, we can be confident that God hears and answers our prayers of intercession.  As we stand in the gap for brothers and sisters, God will honor those prayers.
