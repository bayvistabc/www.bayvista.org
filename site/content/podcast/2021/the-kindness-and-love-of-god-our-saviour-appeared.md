The First Advent of our Lord and Savior, Jesus, The Christ.  When the kindness and love of God appeared to mankind.  On this day, we celebrate the birth of Christ, we light the Christ candle.  And Brother Danny Shares from the book of Titus, chapter 3, that God's kindness and love were not because of righteous things that we had done, but because of God's mercy alone.  In Christ, that mercy was made manifest.  And in Christ, our hope for eternal life has been revealed.
