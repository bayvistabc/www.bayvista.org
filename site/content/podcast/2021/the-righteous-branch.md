This morning we celebrated the second week of advent with the lighting of the candle of peace. Brother Danny shared with us from the book of Jeremiah that we have a promise to cherish. We need to remember that God keeps His word and will send a deliverer. And that one day the peace that He will shower upon us will be fully known.
