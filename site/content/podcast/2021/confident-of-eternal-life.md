This morning, Brother Danny takes us through 1 John 5:11-13.  In this short passage, he reiterates the point of John's letter to the church, and that is so that they may know that they have eternal life.  John wanted his readers to know that they could have assurance of their salvation, and the eternal life that comes with that.  We can share in that assurance, knowing that A) Eternal life is a gift from God that does not depend upon us, B) Eternal life is found only in the Son of God and no other, and C) Eternal life can only be a reality through faith in the Son.
