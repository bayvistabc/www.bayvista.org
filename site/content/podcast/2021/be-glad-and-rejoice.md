This morning, the third Sunday of Advent, we celebrate JOY!  As we look forward to the full realization of out faith, we need to remember that God will quiet our fears.  No matter what we face, fear does not have to reign in our hearts.  God will also join in our celebration; He takes great joy in moving us closer to His side!  God will wecome us home to the new Jerusalem.  And finally, God will restore our fortunes.  Though that may not be in the way that we expect, all of the pain caused by sin will be removed from our existence and we will finally be made whole.
