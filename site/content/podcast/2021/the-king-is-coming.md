This morning, we celebrated the first week of Advent, with our scripture and message being focused on Hope.  Brother Danny shared from Malachi chapter 3, which shows us that the foundation of our hope is in the promise found in this passage.  We need to remember that God works to bring His plans and purposes to reality.  No matter our perspective of timing, God's plans will always come to fruition.  When the time is right, the Lord will come.  We need to be prepared for whenever that time may come.  And, ultimately, He will bring cleansing to His people.  He will not leave us in our sin.
