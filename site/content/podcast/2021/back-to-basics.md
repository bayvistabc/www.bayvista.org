This morning, using the text from 2 Chronicles 30, verses 1 through 9, Brother Danny calls the church to go back to basics.  In this text, we find three truths that the church needs to take hold of.  First, we need to return to what has been neglected.  For the people of Judah, that was the observance of the Passover.  For the church of today, we need to return to the spiritual disciplines that we once had a passion for.  Second, we must pay attention to God's call to return.  God always calls his people to return to him before he brings punishment in their lives.  We must be willing to listen.  Finally, we need to follow through with our commitments to return.  God is calling the church to return to him, we must decide if we will heed the call.
