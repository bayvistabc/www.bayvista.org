This morning, Brother Danny shared from the prophecy of Isaiah, chapter 55, verses 1 through 3.  In this passage, God says three things to his covenant people, and these three things have great implication for the church.  First, God says "I can freely give you what you need."  God's grace is what we need in order to be renewed and awakened to the call of the gospel.  Second, God says "I can offer you a satisfaction that the world cannot."  No matter where we may try to find satisfaction, only God can give us what our soul desires.  Finally, God says "I can fulfill your life with a faithful love."  As many people in the church struggle with self doubt, God offers us His amazing covenant love.
