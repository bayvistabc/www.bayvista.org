This morning, Brother Danny continues the "Why Are We Here" series, following-up from worship to discipleship.  As he shared from Isaiah 26, verses 7 through 9, Danny pointed out three truths about the desire to follow God.  First, the desire to follow God can only be built upon trust in God.  No natural man will ever desire to follow God in his life.  That desire will only be found in the Christian.  The desire to follow God is shaped by a hunger to really know him.  As the Christian walks with Christ more and more, we realize how little we know him.  Finally, in response to that faith that we have placed in God, and to the desire to know him more, we develop the desire to follow Him by dilligently seeking Him in all of our activities, not just when we come to church on Sunday.
