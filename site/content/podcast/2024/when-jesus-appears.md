In today's sermon we celebrated the very special day of Jesus' resurection. The sermon today was a powerful message brought to us by Brother Danny, about how our lives can be filled with true peace when Jesus makes Himself known to us. This yearly celebration reminds us that we are never truly alone in our walks of life and how important it is that we share the good news of His life, death and resurection.
