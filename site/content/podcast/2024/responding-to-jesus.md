This morning, we looked at John's Gospel, chapter 4, verses 16 through 30.  In this passage, we Jesus dealing gently with the woman of Sychar, as he reveals himself to her as the Messiah.  Let us take this passage and be encouraged to share Jesus with our Samaritans, remembering that people can't respond to Jesus if they never meet him.
