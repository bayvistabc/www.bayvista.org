Bay Vista has altered our schedule during this pandemic &ndash; ~~out of an abundance~~ using an appropriate level of caution, and complying with city and state requirements &ndash; to protect our more vulnerable members.

## In-Person Schedule Adjustments

- In compliance with the Mississippi state and Biloxi city shelter-in-place and safer-at-home orders, in-person Sunday activities are canceled; church leadership is currently working on a reopening plan, and will make that plan public once it is ready. Service pages for each week:
    - [This Week - May 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2020](/covid-19/this-week/)
    - [April 26<sup>th</sup>, 2020][04-26] _<small>(added May 2<sup>nd</sup>)</small>_
    - [April 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020][04-19] _<small>(added April 25<sup>th</sup>)</small>_
    - [April 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020 - Easter Sunday][04-12] _<small>(added April 18<sup>th</sup>)</small>_
    - [April 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020 - Palm Sunday][04-05] _<small>(added April 4<sup>th</sup>)</small>_
    - [March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2020][03-29] _<small>(added March 28<sup>th</sup>)</small>_
    - [March 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2020][03-22] _<small>(added March 21<sup>st</sup>)</small>_
- The Crusader Luncheon for May 5<sup>th</sup> has been canceled. _<small>(added April 18<sup>th</sup>)</small>_
- All Wednesday evening activities will not meet until after our first Sunday back.
- The church office will be open normal hours (Monday-Thursday, 8:30am to 1pm).
- For any regularly-scheduled committee meeting, contact the chairman of that committee.
- The church leadership will meet again after further guidance is released from Mississippi's governor or Biloxi's mayor during the coming week, to evaluate our plans to resume meeting in person. _<small>(updated April 18<sup>th</sup>)</small>_

_(See the end of the page for past postponements/cancellations.)_

## Staying Connected

- Sermons for each week will be available on this site each Sunday morning _(instead of the usual Monday post date)_. Each sermon will be accompanied by a link to a set of songs that will help you worship and prepare your heart to listen to the message.
- Sunday School lessons will be shared here and on [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/68059906209/) for personal study and family discussion.
- Please continue tithing, as the expenses to keep Bay Vista running will not noticeably decrease during this period. [Tithes can be given online](/giving/), dropped off at the chuch office when it is open, mailed to the address at the bottom of this page. _<small>(added online giving April 2<sup>nd</sup>)</small>_
- Worship Arts groups will be contacted by their group leaders to address adjusting for the loss of rehearsal time.

## Why We Made This Decision

This virus appears to have a light to moderate effect on healthy people; however, in older people, or those whose immune systems are already compromised, its effects have been much greater. People who are barely affected can spread the virus to those whose bodies are much less well-equipped to fight it off. While it is true, as Paul told Timothy, that "God has not given us a spirit of fear, but one of power, love, and sound judgment" ([2 Timothy 1:7, CSB][2ti1.7]), our Lord also told us to "be wise as serpents and innocent as doves" ([Matthew 10:16, ESV][ma10.16]). With Mississippi's governor's decree prohibiting gatherings of 10 or more until April 17th, and with scientific estimates that the curve is trending up, we are following his guidance. We also trust in the sovereignty of God, that He will still be able to use us to accomplish His will, encourage one another, and draw the lost to Him.

## An Encouraging Word

Martin Luther, the German reformer, served during the time of the Black Plague. Following are his words written to Dr. John Hess _(taken from his Works, volume 43, page 132)_:

> I shall ask God mercifully to protect us. Then I shall fumigate, help purify the air, administer medicine and take it. I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance inflict and pollute others and so cause their death as a result of my negligence. If God should wish to take me, He will sure find me and I have done what he has expected of me and so I am not responsible for either my own death or the death of others. If my neighbor needs me however I shall not avoid place or person by will go freely as stated above. See this is such a God-fearing faith because it is neither brash nor foolhardy and does not tempt God.

Our ministry does not stop during this time, and we pray that we look back and see that this has all been much ado about nothing.

## Past Postponements/Cancellations

The originally scheduled dates for these events has passed; they have been moved here to keep the list above shorter.

- Joe Agustin's memorial service on March 23<sup>rd</sup> was postponed, and the fellowship meal following was canceled.
- The Crusader luncheon on April 7<sup>th</sup> was canceled.
- The Maundy Thursday service on April 9<sup>th</sup> was canceled; however, [here is a plan you can follow](/covid-19/april-9-2020/) to remember the day when Jesus changed the meaning of Passover forever.
