The club emphasizes Scripture memorization for children 3 years through the sixth grade. The children will participate in games, songs, scripture learning, and practical lessons all under the guidance of our faithfully committed staff. A.W.A.N.A. is an outreach to our children, helping them to learn the Word of God and develop their personal relationship with their Savior Jesus Christ. We covet your prayer support for this ministry.
