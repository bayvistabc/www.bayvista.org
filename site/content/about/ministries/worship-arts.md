## Scripture Readings

The children of Israel used to gather at the tabernacle or temple, just to hear the Word of God read aloud. We incorporate the public reading of Scripture in our worship services, though both traditional and responsive readings. If you believe that God wants you to participate in our worship services by reading His Word, let us know before or after a service; any member can volunteer!

## Drama

Are you a real character? Some really are, and we need lots of characters for our Drama Ministry. Players perform sketches, skits, and plays at various times throughout the year to enhance worship. Drama allows you to be what you were created to be...a character!

WAIT! Even if youâ€™re not excited about reciting lines, ask about non-speaking roles and support roles such as set design, prop master, costuming, etc.

## Banners

Banners play an important visual role in worship. Whether hanging on the wall or marching down the aisle, banners encourage us to focus on the One we worship, God. If you like to sew, cut, glitter, glue, or otherwise be creative with fabrics, we need your help.
