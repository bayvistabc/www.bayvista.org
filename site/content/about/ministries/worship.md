Worship is central to what we do at Bay Vista, and relates to each of our three main focus areas:

* Worship directly connects us to God, whenever we choose to do it.
* Corporate worship opportunities help connect us with other believers.
* During times of worship, we are more acutely aware of the Lord's prompting towards the areas in which He would have us serve.

To be sure, worship is much more than music; using those two terms as synonyms is unnecessarily narrow. Romans 12:1-2a (NIV) says, _"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of Godâ€™s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God - this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."_ Tranforming our minds may include music, but certainly goes way beyond it!

[Music](music/), both vocal and instrumental, is a big part of our worship ministries; we also utilize [media teams](media-teams/) (sound, lights, and projection) and [worship arts](arts) (Scripture readings, drama, and banners). As the name implies, the sole focus of these varied aspects is to celebrate our Savior, and focus our hearts on worshipping Him, and prepare us for hearing His message for us each week.

Worship involves everyone! To learn more about these opportunities, just click on the words in the first sentence of the previous paragraph.
