In addition to Bible Studies, monthly book club, and discipleship, there are also plenty of activities that are just plain fun. There are also special events such as retreats, camps, concerts, and trips planned for them throughout the year.

This year we are adding AWANAâ€™s [Trek][] and [Journey][] programs to our teen ministry. Check out the links below.
