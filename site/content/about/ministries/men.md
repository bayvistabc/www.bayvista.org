<img class="pull-left size-full" alt="breakfast" src="/img/stock/breakfast.jpg" width="384" height="311">This group meets every third Saturday of the month at 8:00 AM in the [FLC](/about-us/campus-map/) building. After a nourishing breakfast, encouraging fellowship, and an inspiring devotion, these men tackle a pre-determined ministry project either on or off campus. Join us this month.
