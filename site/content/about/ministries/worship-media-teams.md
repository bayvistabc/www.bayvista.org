## Sound

Sound plays a critical role in our worship services. From providing pre-recorded music and accompaniaments, to mixing instruments and voices, the sound technicians make it all sound good! If you have an ear for sound and enjoy the "behind the scenes" work that makes the "front and center" stuff possible, we need your help. Never worked on a sound board before? No problem! We can provide the training to get you started. [Call](/contact-us/) our office to express your interest.

## Projection

Projection enables our blended music style, as we can incorporate new (or old) songs that may not be in the hymnals in our pews. It also helps worshippers look up, or even close their eyes as they sing, without having to keep their place in a book. We can use volunteers with even a very basic knowledge of computers and a heart for worship. If you're comfortable working in Windows and checking e-mail, we can train you to work in the projection booth. We'll stay with you until you can confidently display text and video for the services.  [Call](/contact-us/) our office for more info.
