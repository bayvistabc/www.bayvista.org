Here are answers to some common questions that folks have when visiting Bay Vista:

### Will I be singled out as a guest?

Absolutely not. We make a general announcement to guests during the service that welcomes them and asks them to fill out a guest ticket if they would like more information about Bay Vista. We do not ask them to stand or identify themselves.

### What do people wear?

We don't make a big deal about what people wear to church. We would never want this to hinder anyone from coming to our church, and especially to Christ. At the same time, we believe there is value in teaching our children that respect is often communicated even in the way we present ourselves. Our dress code is best described as "coast casual." You will see people in everything from suits and ties all the way down to nice jeans and a sports shirt.

### Am I supposed to put money in the offering plate?

At Bay Vista, we do not "collect" the offerings. We "present" them to the Lord. During our offering time we encourage everyone to bring their tithes, offerings, guest tickets, and prayer requests joyfully down to the altar. Guests should not feel obligated to participate, but should feel welcome to do so as the Lord leads. [more...](/about-us/what-we-believe/#about-tithing)

### What about Communion?

Occasionally (usually about once per quarter) we offer communion during Sunday morning services. This is a time of self-reflection and praise for the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made on our behalf. Because of that, this time of fellowship with the Lord is reserved for professing Christians. If you are a follower of Jesus Christ, then we invite and encourage you to participate.
