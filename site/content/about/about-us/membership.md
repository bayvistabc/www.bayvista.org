Becoming a member is a public affirmation that you believe God has called you to serve Him with us here at Bay Vista. We expect our members to serve God with their faithful attendance in worship and small group Bible study (Sunday school), with their tithes and offerings, and by serving alongside us in one or more of the ministry opportunities offered here.

There are three ways you can join the church:

1. By profession of faith: Trusting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and following Him in believer's baptism.
2. By letter: Moving your membership from another Baptist church or from another evangelical church that practices believer's baptism.
3. By statement of faith: Affirming your commitment to Christ and participating in believer's baptism by immersion.

If you have any questions, or if you would like more information about joining the Bay Vista family please call the church office at 228-388-1166 to make an appointment with a pastor.
